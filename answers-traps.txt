1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a0-a7 contain arguments to function and a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?
 (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

There are no calls to function after compiling, because it was changed to inline functions that a1 = 12 called directly.

3.At what address is the function printf located?

ra=pc=0x30, so the address is  0x30+1528(0x5f8)=0x628

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x34 +4 = 0x38(+4 becauser of PC which ensure can get back)

5.Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output? 

He110 World; %s output the string which begin with &i;if changes, i need to be changed while 57616 not.

6.In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

It depends on the argument of a2, because it need to argument of a2.
